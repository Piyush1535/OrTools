The code uses ORTools 7.x
Aim of the code is to get latitudes and longitudes from the CSV file and use it to develop a program that will optimise the route for any number of vehicles.
Vehicles have to travel from pickup locations and need to pick load from there then have to deliver it to the desired location.
Code uses distance matrix as we have to minimize the total distance travelled!

**Note: The solution given by code might note be optimum as we have to compromise accuracy for time required to execute the code.
